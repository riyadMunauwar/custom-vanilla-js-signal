## Introduction

This document describes an industry-standard grade implementation of signals, a reactive primitive for managing state in JavaScript applications. Signals provide a simple and efficient way to create reactive values and computations, enabling fine-grained reactivity and optimal performance.

## API Reference

### createSignal

Creates a new signal with an initial value.

```javascript
const [getValue, setValue] = createSignal(initialValue);
```

- `getValue`: A function that returns the current value of the signal.
- `setValue`: A function that updates the value of the signal.

### createEffect

Creates a new effect that automatically tracks its dependencies and re-runs when they change.

```javascript
const dispose = createEffect(effectFn);
```

- `effectFn`: A function that defines the effect.
- Returns a dispose function to clean up the effect.

### createMemo

Creates a memoized computation that only updates when its dependencies change.

```javascript
const getValue = createMemo(computeFn);
```

- `computeFn`: A function that computes the memoized value.
- Returns a getter function for the memoized value.

### batch

Batches multiple signal updates to prevent unnecessary re-computations.

```javascript
batch(() => {
  // Multiple signal updates
});
```

### untrack

Prevents tracking of signal reads within a function.

```javascript
const value = untrack(() => signal());
```

## Usage Examples

Basic usage:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
const double = createMemo(() => count() * 2);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Count: ${count()}, Double: ${double()}`);
});

setCount(5); // Logs: Count: 5, Double: 10
```

Advanced usage with batching:

```javascript
const [firstName, setFirstName] = createSignal('John');
const [lastName, setLastName] = createSignal('Doe');
const fullName = createMemo(() => `${firstName()} ${lastName()}`);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Full name changed: ${fullName()}`);
});

batch(() => {
  setFirstName('Jane');
  setLastName('Smith');
});
// Logs: Full name changed: Jane Smith (only once)
```

## Advanced Concepts

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Signals and memos are lazily evaluated, meaning they only compute their value when read.

2. **Automatic Dependency Tracking**: Effects and memos automatically track their dependencies without manual subscription management.

3. **Glitch-Free Updates**: The implementation ensures consistent state during updates, preventing "glitches" where intermediate inconsistent states are observed.

4. **Cleanup**: Effects can return a cleanup function that's called before the effect re-runs or when it's disposed.

```javascript
createEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => console.log('Tick'), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
});
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Fine-Grained Updates**: Only the specific values that change trigger updates, minimizing unnecessary computations.

2. **Batching**: Use the `batch` function for multiple updates to prevent cascading re-computations.

3. **Memoization**: Use `createMemo` for expensive computations that depend on signals.

4. **Untracking**: Use `untrack` to prevent unnecessary dependencies when reading signals.

## Comparison with Other Reactive Systems

- **vs. React's useState**: Signals provide more fine-grained reactivity and don't require a component re-render for updates.
- **vs. Vue's Reactivity**: Similar in concept, but signals are more explicit and don't rely on Proxies.
- **vs. RxJS**: Signals are simpler and more focused on state management, while RxJS provides a full-featured streaming library.

This signal implementation offers a balance of simplicity, performance, and power, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems.
